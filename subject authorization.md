# Subjects can now be Authorized!
When passing through a metal detector, any subjects getting scanned will get a tag above their head once they pass through the detector to show that they have either been authorized or marked for termination.

### If a subject gets the Terminate Tag, is it possible for security to remove the contraband and have them rescanned?
Yes, as long as the subject doesn't attempt to flee or harm staff during the process.

### What kinds of tags can a subject get?
2 types. Clear, and Terminate.
"Clear - No Weapons on User" and "Terminate - Contraband found on User"
